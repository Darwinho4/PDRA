In order to recreate the project, first you would need to create an account on Kodular.
You would need to download the PDRA_RELEASE1.aia file on our Github page as well.
Then, you need to press the import project button on the page and upload the aia file.
You should be good to go from there!
Important: other app designers like MIT app inventor doesn’t work, it has to be Kodular.
